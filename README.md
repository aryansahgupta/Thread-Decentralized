The onlyOwner modifier should be used in the changeThreadLength function to ensure only the owner can change it n also, change the owner variable immutable .since itâ€™s set only once in the constructor. heres the codes::
1.address public immutable owner;
2.function changeThreadLength(uint16 newThreadLength) public onlyOwner {}
